CHROMA 0.0.2
================================================================================

Editor-only Unity extension that color-codes your Hierarchy and Project folders
so large scenes stay readable — with zero runtime cost.

QUICK START
-----------
1. Open Tools > Chroma

2. Select a GameObject and:
   - Choose a color and style in the panel
   - Click "Apply banner" (stores in name) or "Add component"

3. See it colored in the Hierarchy instantly

Done! Customize more in Settings tab (tree lines, separators, themes, etc.)


REQUIREMENTS
------------
• Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer (developed on Unity 6)
• Editor-only — no runtime impact

FEATURES
--------
• Colored Banners — Turn any GameObject into a colored header:
  - By name: rename like "#1f6feb center bold=Title" (solid color or gradients)
  - By component: add ChromaBanner component (keeps the GameObject name clean)

• Separators — Create visual dividers by naming objects "---" or "___"

• Custom Banner Font — Use a Font asset or any installed system font
  (Sans / Serif / Mono / Comic quick-picks) for banner & separator text

• Tree Guide Lines — File explorer style connector lines in the indent gutter

• Auto-Color Rules — Tint rows by Tag, Layer, name prefix, or regex pattern

• Child Color Inheritance — Children inherit colors from parent banners (flat or depth-fade)

• Display Extras — Child count "(N)", zebra striping, missing-script warnings,
  bookmarks (jump & reorder)

• Project Window — Color folders in the Project window

• RGB Mode — Animate hierarchy rows through rainbow colors (~30fps)

• Themes — Quick preset color schemes (Minimal, Vibrant, Soft, High-Contrast)

• Build Stripping — Banners are removed from built scenes (zero runtime footprint)
